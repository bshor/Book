Across all four waves, a total of 45 dichotomous survey responses about health-related policy issues, and 94 dichotomous survey responses about non-health related policy issues were asked. 7.2 Self-reported vs Latent We estimate an ideal point based on two-item item-response model (Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004) estimated in a single dimension. While typically ideal point models are estimated for politicians, they can be straightforwardly estimated for survey respondents (Jessee 2012). Recent research has shown that American public opinion is largely one-dimensional, like that of politicians (Fowler et al. 2022). 7.3 Validating the measures Table 7.1 shows the correlations between the two self-reported measures of three-category party identification (Democrat, Republican, or true Independent1) and seven-category symbolic ideology (from strong liberal, or 1, to strong conservative, or 7), as well as the two latent measures of ideology. The correlations are all in the expected range. Partisanship is strongly correlated with ideology, both symbolic and latent. Symbolic and latent ideology are also strongly correlated with each other. Table 7.1: Correlations between latent and self-reported measures of party and ideology Party ID Self-Reported Ideology Latent Health Ideology Latent Non-Health Ideology Party ID 1 . . . Self-Reported Ideology .67 1 . . Latent Health Ideology .51 .52 1 . Latent Non-Health Ideology .63 .67 .65 1 Notice, however, that the correlations of health ideology are substantially weaker with partisanship and symbolic ideology, as compared to non-health ideology. We can see this graphically by plotting the density curves of both measures, broken out by partisanship (Figure 7.1) and self-reported ideology (Figure 7.2. Health ideology, then, is substantially less polarized than ideology about non-health subjects. More broadly, notice that ideology is substantially less polarized in general than the typical picture for politicians like state legislators and members of Congress, where there is either vanishingly little or even no overlap in the density curves for partisans. The public’s ideology looks familiar, but it is in no way a mirror image of politicians’ belief systems. Figure 7.1: Health and Non-health latent ideology by 3-category party identification Figure 7.2: Health and Non-health latent ideology by 7-category self-reported ideology 7.3.1 Predicting issue opinion I use the latent ideology measure as primary predictors in models of issue response. I regress them plus party and self-reported ideology on a variety of issue opinions. Table 7.2 shows several linear probability models. The first is generic Affordable Care Act approval. Next is opinion about expanding Medicaid within the respondent’s state. Third is approval of Covid-19 vaccine mandates at schools. Finally, respondents are asked about the responsibility of states to cap the cost of insulin for diabetic patients. All in all, these various policy opinions tap a variety of issues, both those closely tied to partisanship and the first dimension of ideological conflict over the size and scope of the government (ACA Approval, Covid School Mandates) and those that are smaller in connection to partisanship or are less salient (Medicaid Expansion, Insulin Price Caps). The coefficients are standardized in the Gelman (2008) fashion by dividing by two standard deviations to facilitate comparison of effect size within-model. As expected, the two more partisan issues show a greater effect of respondent partisan identification; in fact partisanship fades almost completely away for the latter two issues. For example, while Medicaid expansion or price caps on particular pharmaceutical products is often touted as a partisan issue, this simple model reveals that these issues are in fact much better described as ideological. But what kind of ideology? Health-related latent ideology appears to be a much stronger predictor of policy opinions on important policy issues than does a more generalized latent ideology, or self-described ideological identification.

Certainly not. See the following set of placebo models as an example. This shows the exact same models as above, except with three non-health related policy measures as dependent variables. These including support for fracking, the death penalty, and concealled carry policy for guns. In all cases, non-health related ideology is strongly positively related with positions on these issues; that is, a respondent who is more conservative on this scale is more likely to take the conservative position on these three hot-button ideological issues. That’s not a surprise. What is surprising is how the sign on health ideology flips in the opposite direction. Here, controlling for non-health ideology, health conservatism predicts a liberal position on these issues. Of course, this weird result is likely a statistical artifact of multicollinearity between the measures. Still, it shows that our health measure works appropriately in the correct context, and–just as important–works poorly in the incorrect context. It has passed the placebo test.
